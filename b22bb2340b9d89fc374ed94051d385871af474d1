Update to a build with this change included\n3. Create new work profile or user, install all apps.\n\nIf installation works, they must be the same sig.\n\nWe do have 33358: [installer] Improve ApkInstaller | https://review.calyxos.org/c/CalyxOS/platform_external_calyx_lupin/+/33358\n\nBut regardless, Android doesn\u0027t let you install the same package name with different signature in different work profile / users anyways.",
